Leetcode 921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid,Stack,Medium,"Given a sequence of parenthesis, output the number of minimum parenthesis that need to be added to make the sequence a valid parenthesis string. ","Use stack to keep track of the current state. If we encounter (, then add one to the stack. If we encounter ), then pop one from the stack. Answer is the number of elements in the stack",Subtract the number of open parathesis with close.,Count the total number of parentheses and divide by 2 to find the minimum additions needed.,
Lintcode 460. Find K Closest Elements,Binary Search,Medium,"Find the k closest numbers to target in a sorted array, sorted in ascending order by the difference between the number and target.",Use binary search to find the closest number in the array to the target. Then go to left and right until finding k numbers.,"Compute the differences for all elements and sort them, then select the first k elements.","Linearly scan the array to find the closest number, then select the next k-1 elements.","Think solution 7min, write code (2bugs) 5 min, read solution (5min)"
Lintcode 1712. Binary Subarrays With Sum,Two Pointers,Medium,"In an array A of 0s and 1s, how many non-empty subarrays have sum S?","Sliding Window. Extend the right pointer until we exceeds the sum. Then, increase the left pointer to remove 1s in the window to restore the sum.",,Use a single pointer to find subarrays with sum S,
Leetcode 79. Word Search,DFS,Medium,"Given an 2d  grid of characters, check if a given word exists in the grid.","Run a DFS on every cell. Keep a visited array. dfs(i,j,word) means whether the bottom right board contains the rest of the word.",Run DFS at the top left corner once.,Linearly scan the grid and compare each subarray of length equal to the word's length.,
